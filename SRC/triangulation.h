 * @brief The grid structure
 * 
 * @param fdp : priority queue of simplex to know which one to treat next
 * @param candidates_to_redistrubute :Â a doubly linked list which stores during one delaunay round
 * (ie. insertion of one point and computation of any changes required) all the candidates which will be redistribute
 * between all the recently created and/or modified simplices.
 * @param top_of_stack : A pointer to the first simplex to unstack (ie. the last added). Each simplex have a pointer to the 
 * next one (next_in_stack)
 * @param stack_size : Number of simplex currently in stack.
 * @param new : A table of fix but expandable size (thanks to realloc if needed) which stores at every delaunay iteration 
 * the recently created and/or modified simpices in order to iterate through and redistribute candidates in candidates_to_redistrubute
 * @param new_current_size : The current size of the table described above (new). In other terms the number of element currently in the table.
 * @param new_max_size : The maximum number of simplex pointers that you can currently store in new table. 
 * If new_current_size > new_max_size then new is reallocated.
 * @param gof : Goodness of fit. An output condition between others.
